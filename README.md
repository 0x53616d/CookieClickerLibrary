# CookieClickerLibrary
What is CookieClickerLibrary (AKA ccl) and what is it for?
# Description
I got bored so I made a simple interface that interacts with the game Cookie Clicker to make modifying things about the game easier. open the console, paste the code from 'ccl.js' in, hit enter, type 'ccl' and all of the autofill results will show up.
